# Project 8

## Description of the Project
Project 8 continues the development journey, presenting a robust Movie Search Application that interfaces with a movie database API. Users can search for their favorite movies, view details, and share them with friends. The application uses Retrofit for network operations, Glide for image loading, and incorporates Material Design for a polished user interface.

## Functionality
The application includes the following functionalities:

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **View Movie Details**: Details such as title, year, type, and poster are displayed.
- **Share Functionality**: Users can share movie details.
- **Feedback System**: Users can send feedback from within the app.

### Extensions Implemented
- **Retrofit** for API network calls.
- **Glide** for efficient image loading.
- **RecyclerView** for a performant list of search results.
- **Material Design** for a cohesive and dynamic UI.
